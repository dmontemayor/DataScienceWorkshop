# DataScienceWorkshop
Startup for the development of a data science workshop

___

#Overview
The overarching goal is to develop a formally structured Data Science course at UTHSCSA.
To do this we need to accomplish the following steps
1. Conduct a market analysis including a focus group in the form of a seminar series. (alpha phase)
2. Use market analysis to attract funding and inform the development of an intensive workshop. (beta-testing)
3. Quantify workshop success as preliminary evidence in proposal for the establishment of the final data science course. (production-phase)

# Market analysis
 The goal of this analysis is to avoid putting a lot of resources and time into answering a question before determining that a solution is needed. Furthermore, we need to determine the need for our solution is big enough that some target audence will pay for it. To this extent we designed a market analysis that characterizes our target audience, develops materials that fullfill the needs of this audience, and asseses our ability to meet those needs in the form of a pilot seminar series. The [detailed market analysis](supplemental/MarketAnalysis.md) is provided in supplemental folder.
