# DataScienceWorkshop
Startup for the development of a data science workshop

___

#Overview
The overarching goal is to develop a formally structured Data Science course at UTHSCSA.
To do this we need to accomplish the following steps
1. Conduct a market analysis including a focus group in the form of a seminar series. (alpha phase)
2. Use market analysis to attract funding and inform the development of an intensive workshop. (beta-testing)
3. Quantify workshop success as preliminary evidence in proposal for the establishment of the final data science course. (production-phase)
